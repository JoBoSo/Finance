# make_xl_col_bbg(file) replaces dot seperated tickers in file with bbg tickers.
# make_xl_col_bbg: Str --> None
# How to use make_xl_col_bbg:
#    1. copy a column of dot tickers that you are working with in excel
#    2. paste them in an empty xlsx file in col A and save file
#    3. run the file through make_xl_col_bbg
#    4. find the tickers translated to bloomberg tickers in file
#    5. paste the updated tickers in your working file to pull bbg data
# Note: Run one time. Multiple runs will compound the ticker.
# Requires: 
#    - file is an .xlsx file
#    - tickers in file are dot seperated tickers in col A
